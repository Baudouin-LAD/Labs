**8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.**

We do not have a clue as to how many users rated these apps

select track_name, rating_count_tot, user_rating

Pandora - Music & Radio	1126879	4
Pinterest	1061624	4.5

**11. Do people care about the price of an app?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?

Select avg(price),user_rating

We can only say from that query that people are less forgiving for payed app, but also that a well rated app is typically not free.
